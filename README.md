# Tracks Requests
This project is for music enthusiasts, performers or listeners.

The Heroku hosted version is here: [https://tracksrequests.herokuapp.com/]

We will soon move it to a self-hosted server to ensure that it's accessible at a decent speed and worldwide.

The idea is that sometimes, songs deserve a remix, a cover or any sort of re-work by a different artist or even the original artist, to make it sound even better.

I was very frustrated not to be able to:

- ask Tyler The Creator to make a full length piano cover of 911/Mr Lonely
- ask Kay Tranada to make a remix of Arctic Monkeys' latest track
- ask a super random French artist to make a cover of one of Diplo's tracks
- ... you get the idea

Tracks Requests is here so that anyone can ask for anyone to make a rework of anything, then either wait for someone to do it or do it by themselves and share it to the world.

## Disclaimer

For now this is a Proof Of Concept, I built on my own and there is still a lot to work to do on the stack,the features, the responsive utilities and loads of other stuff are not perfect yet, (privacy, security...)

## Improvements coming (Road Map):

### General improvements:

- Make the app responsive
- Make the app look good

### Login:

- Setup a login with Sound Cloud

### Tracks Requests:

- Ability to set a status (pending, in progress, done)
- Ability to mark an answer as best answer (like in stack overflow)
- Ability to claim a track request
- Ability to search by name, genre, artist

### Bands Requests:

Bands requests are what people use to let the community know that they want to make some covers, remixes and other type of collabs and are actually searching for people to perform with.

### Stack improvements:

- Server Side Rendering
- Tests
