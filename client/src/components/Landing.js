			<h1>Tracks Requests !</h1>

			Ask artists to make covers, remixes, mash ups and everything in-between, from World Class artists or any artist, wanabe artist, occasional artist, fan or creative folk.</h5>
			<h6>Origin of the project</h6>
			<p>
				A while ago we thought about creating a platform where anyone formulate a wish, that an artist makes a cover or a remix of a famous or less famous track of another artist.<br/>
				Recently re-inspired by seeing Tyler, The Creator singing one of his own songs (911, see below) in a very different way, we knew we needed to bring the world a platform to ask artists to give us more of their amazing stuff.<br/> Here is a platform where unknown or debuting artist can find an audience by performing what an avid audience dies to hear. It's also a place where big time artists can make their audiences wishes come true.

				My first request would be that Tyler makes an album of his greatests hits just by himself alone at the piano, really like what William Sheller did.
